/// - Access file information (id, path, content)
/// - Inspect the entire program structure
/// - Report issues at the program level
/// - Pre-register variables before analysis
/// - Skip analysis entirely

    /// `HookAction::Skip` to skip analysis of this program entirely.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Returns [`HookError`] if the underlying plugin implementation propagates one.
