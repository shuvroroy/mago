/// # Arguments
///
/// * `file_id` - The identifier of the file being compared
/// * `old_signature` - The previous file signature (None if this is a new file)
/// * `new_signature` - The current file signature
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A `CodebaseDiff` containing:
/// - `keep`: Symbols that are unchanged
/// - `changed`: Symbols that are new, deleted, or modified
