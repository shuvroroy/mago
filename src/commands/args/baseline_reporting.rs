//! Command-line arguments for baseline-enabled issue reporting.
//!
//! This module provides command-line arguments for managing baseline files
//! in combination with issue reporting. Baselines allow teams to establish
//! a snapshot of existing issues and focus on preventing new issues from
//! being introduced.
//!
//! The baseline functionality supports generating new baselines from current
//! issues, verifying that baselines are up-to-date, and filtering reported
//! issues against a baseline. It also includes options for backup and strict
//! synchronization checking.
