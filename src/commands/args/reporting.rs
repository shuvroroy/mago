//! Command-line arguments for issue reporting and fixing.
//!
//! This module defines [`ReportingArgs`], a reusable set of command-line arguments
//! for controlling how issues are reported and optionally fixed. These arguments
//! can be flattened into any command that needs to report analysis results.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! The reporting arguments control several aspects:
//!
//! - **Output Formatting**: Choose from rich, medium, short, JSON, and other formats
//! - **Output Targeting**: Send output to stdout or stderr
//! - **Issue Filtering**: Filter by fixability, severity level
//! - **Issue Sorting**: Sort issues for better organization
//! - **Automatic Fixing**: Apply fixes with various safety levels
//! - **Fix Previewing**: Dry-run mode to preview fixes without applying them
//!
//! # Fix Safety Levels
//!
//! Fixes are categorized by safety:
//!
//! - **Safe**: Applied by default with `--fix`
//! - **Potentially Unsafe**: Requires `--potentially-unsafe` flag
//! - **Unsafe**: Requires `--unsafe` flag
//!
//! # Exit Codes
//!
//! The `minimum_fail_level` determines when the command exits with failure.
//! This enables CI integration where certain issue severities should fail builds.
